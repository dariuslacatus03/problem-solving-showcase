# Problem Solving Showcase  

This repository serves as a collection of solutions to various coding problems sourced from different platforms, aimed at enhancing problem-solving skills and proficiency in different programming languages.

I will try my best to add in average three problems/day for one year. My plan is to solve 35 easy problems, 20 medium problems and 15 hard problems from each of the following categories:

1. Arrays & Hashing
2. Two Pointers
3. Stack
4. Binary Search
5. Sliding Window
6. Linked Lists
7. Trees
8. Backtracking
9. Heap/Priority Queue
10. Graphs
11. 1D Dynamic Programming
12. 2D Dynamic Programming
13. Greedy
14. Advanced Graphs
